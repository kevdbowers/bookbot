# bookbot

BookBot is a simple project designed to read a .txt file containing a book, then print a report including both word count and a count of alphabetical characters in order of how many times they appear. This project was created using Python 3.

This project contains a main.py file which is used to run the program and a stats.py file which contains the functions imported into main.py to generate a report.  This project requires the Python sys module.

To run this program enter the following in the command line:  python3 main.py <path_to_book>
    with <path_to_book> being replaced by the relative path to the .txt file you wish to use.

The BookBot was created as part of a guided [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.
